In this course our team implements the dynamic model of Schunk`s  reconfigurable modular robot manipulator LWA 4P. We use Matlab and Simulink to implement the single modules. For that we first obtain the Equations of Motion using the Newton-Euler-formulation. We characterize the modules for an automatic modelling method by providing estimates for masses and inertia tensors using measurements and CAD data, so that the EoM can be automatically achieved. We then provide the preliminary Simulink model for the robotic arm.  Secondly, we identify the dynamic modell of the actuators. With Black-Box identification and with White-Box identification. In the next step, we implement a simulator of the robot by enhancing the simulink model including saturation effects and possible delays and validate the model using measurements. The fourth step is to design and tune the decentralized controllers while considering limitations due to the sampling time and test them on the robot. We finally test the controllers with a trajectory planner modelling the kinematic behaviour, which is developed by our second team.
