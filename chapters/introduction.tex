As robots are getting more and more complicated, modular robots play an important role in robotics. Modular robots consist of independent cubes, which can connect themselves in different ways in order to fulfill a task. Each of the cubes has its own power supply and intelligence and can have specific tools for solving a problem under special conditions. After a computer has been fed a problem, it analyzes it and connects to the cubes in such a way that it can solve the problem. The cubes have the same size in modular robots in opposite to fractal robots, which can have cubes of different sizes. The cubes can be practically identical built, with similar software implementations, so that the input data and combinations of moduls determines how the task is executed.
